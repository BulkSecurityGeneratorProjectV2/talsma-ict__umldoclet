# About the _lib_ directory

This doclet has a dependency on the PlantUML library.
Unfortunately, the apache licensed version is unavailable from Maven Central.

Therefore, we build PlantUML from the Apache-Licensed source files and include
it in our doclet.

The Apache licensed sources can be [downloaded from Sourceforge][plantuml-asl-location].
